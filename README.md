# Movie-Genre-Classification
# Overview
This project implements a movie genre classification system using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify movies into different genres based on their descriptions. The project includes implementations using Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (specifically Bernoulli Naive Bayes), and a basic Naive Bayes classifier.

# Features
- Data Processing: Converts movie descriptions into numerical features using TF-IDF and binary representations.
- Classification Algorithms:
-- Random Forest
-- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
-- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Evaluation: Provides accuracy and detailed classification metrics for model evaluation.
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
